# What is programming?

Programming means writing instructions for a computer to perform desired actions.
It is one of the most in-demand skills in the world.
Mobile apps, video games, websites, or any other piece of software is written by a programmer.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
```
