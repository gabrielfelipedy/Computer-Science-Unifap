In this subject, we're going to study all stuff we need to know to understand how the world works.

We're gonna study:

<br><br>

* Newton's Laws applicated to Calculus
* Oscilations
* Fluids and Thermodynamics Laws

<br><br>
Let's start understaing something about vectors:

# Vectors

Let´s start this subject with a question:
<br><br>
## How can we find the position of a particle in space ❓
<br><br>
We can answer this question in many ways, let's choose this one:

> *Choosing an referential from a Coordinate System*

<br><br>

  <p><em>Cartesian Coordinate System</em></p>
  <p><em>Polar Coordinate System</em></p>
  <p><em>Cylindrical Coordinate System</em></p>
</div>

<br><br>
For now, we're just gonna study the Cartesian Coordinate System

# Cartesian Coordinate System

This System is based on 3 axis (x, y and z) perpendicular to each other, where x represents the width, y the weight and z the height.

<br><br>
For to locate a poit in the space throught this System, we need to specify 3 number (for x, y and x respectively)

<br><br>

If we wanna study the movement of a particle, we must indentify its position vector.
<br>

## ⚠️ ⚠️ Wait ❗ What's a vector ❔

There's an answer from [mathinsight.org](https://mathinsight.org/vector_introduction) right down:

> A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vector and with an arrow indicating the direction. The direction of the vector is from its tail to its head.
<br>

<br><br>

Knowing this, we can define what's an position vector:
<br>

> Position vector is used to help us find the location of one object relative to another object. Position vectors usually start at the origin and then terminate at any other arbitrary point. Thus, these vectors are used to determine the position of a particular point with reference to its origin.

<p>A vector is useful to locate a particle in space.</p>
