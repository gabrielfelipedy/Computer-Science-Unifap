# Intuitive Definition of a Limit 

Suppose $f(x)$ is defined when x is near the number $a$. (This means that $f$ is defined on some open interval that contains $a$, except possibly at $a$ itself.) Then we write: 

$$\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$

and say “the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $a$, equals $L$” 

if we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ (as close to $L$ as we like) by restricting $x$ to be sufficiently close to $a$ (on either side of $a$) but not equal to $a$.

# One-Sided Limits

Definition of One-Sided Limits:

We write $$\lim\limits_{x \to a^{-}} f(x) = L$$ and say the left-hand limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ [or the limit of $f(x)$ as  x approaches $a$ from the left] is equal to $L$ if we can make the values of $f(x)$  arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ to be sufficiently close to a with $x$ less than $a$.
